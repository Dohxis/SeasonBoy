# Sezonia

Board game made for Ludum Dare 35.

Welcome to Sezonia hero! Please help us! We need you to lead our army against the evil Janesia tribe! If we lose
seasons will be gone forever and our planet will die! Only you can win against this unstoppable power!

## Seasons
In Sezonia we have 4 seasons, they will help you to win. Every season has its cons and pros. For example it's a good
opportunity to attack as much neutral territories in Autumn and stay back from it while it's Winter. Stacking your army
can turn game into your favor.

| Season        | Effect        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Winter     | All neutral territories turns from 1 to 2; Enemy cannot attack  |
| Spring      | Enemy gets ``-2``; |
| Summer | You get ``+2``; |
| Autumn | All neutral territories turns from 1 to 0; Enemy gets ``+2``;     |

If all seasons passes you will get ``+6`` for that turn!

## Buffs
Here in Sezonia we have 2 magical places. If you managed to capture them, you will get huge advantage over your opponent.
These magical places are called Juins and they give ``+5`` every round each.
